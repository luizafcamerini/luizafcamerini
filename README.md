### Hi there 👋 & Welcome to my GitHub 🐙

My name is Luíza Camerini, I'm Brazilian, born and raised in Rio. I'm a Computer Science undergraduate at PUC-Rio (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro). I have experience in multiple programming languages, tools and platforms such as...

- Python
- SQL
- HTML5 & CSS3
- PostgreSQL
- Neo4j
- Pandas
- LangChain
- Neo4j GraphRAG
- Docker

...which I learned all in university and in multiple technology internships.

In regards to professional experiences, I got to code ETL scripts for a medical records relational database for indigenous people in Brazil, an recommendation algorithm for an online supermarket app, a Front-End interface for a sales analytics app, and many more web and database related systems. (You can check all about my previous experiences [right here!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luizacamerini))

🔥 Some of my current interests are:
- Graph Databases: I'm a huge Neo4j fan;
- RAG: using frameworks such as LangChain and Neo4j GraphRAG;
- Large Language Models: through foundation models like Cohere Command R;
- Agentic AI: using n8n;
