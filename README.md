### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is LuÃ­za Camerini, I'm Brazilian and I live in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I'm a Computer Science undergraduate at PUC-Rio (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro). I have experience in Python, C, Java, React.js and SQL, which I learned all in university and in multiple technology internships.

In regards to professional experiences, I got to code ETL scripts for a medical records relational database for indigenous people in Brazil, an recomendation algorithm for an online supermarket app, and more.

Some of my (main) current interests are:
- Large Language Models: through foundation models like Cohere;
- RAG: using tools like LangChain;
- Graph Databases: I'm a huge fan of Neo4j!;
- Relational Databases: using platforms like PostgerSQL.
