### Hi there 👋 & Welcome to my GitHub 🐙

My name is Luíza Camerini, I'm Brazilian and I was born and raised in Rio. I'm a Computer Science undergraduate at PUC-Rio (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro). I have experience in multiple programming languages such as...

- Python
- C
- Java
- React.js
- SQL

...which I learned all in university and in multiple technology internships.

In regards to professional experiences, I got to code ETL scripts for a medical records relational database for indigenous people in Brazil, an recomendation algorithm for an online supermarket app, a Front-End interface for a sales analytics app, and many more web and database related systems. (You can check all about my previous works [right here!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luizacamerini))

🔥 Some of my current interests are:
- Graph Databases: I'm a huge Neo4j fan! ;
- RAG: using frameworks such as LangChain and Neo4j GraphRAG;
- Large Language Models: through foundation models like Cohere Command R;
- Relational Databases: using platforms like PostgreSQL.
