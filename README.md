### Hi there 👋 & Welcome to my GitHub 🐙

My name is Luíza Camerini, I'm Brazilian and I live in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I'm a Computer Science undergraduate at PUC-Rio (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro). I have experience in Python, C, Java, React.js and SQL, which I learned all in university and in multiple technology internships.

In regards to professional experiences, I got to code ETL scripts for a medical records relational database for indigenous people in Brazil, an recomendation algorithm for an online supermarket app, a Front-End interface for an sales analytics app, and more.

🔥 Some of my (main) current interests are:
- Large Language Models: through foundation models like Cohere;
- RAG: using frameworks such as LangChain;
- Graph Databases: I'm a huge Neo4j fan! ;
- Relational Databases: using platforms like PostgreSQL.
